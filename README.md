There are serveral files in this repo which depends on your print bed

For Large print beds use the following file which is the front plate in one file
- frontplate_onepiece.stl

For Smaller print beds use the following files which need to be glued together
- frontplate_lefthalf.stl
- frontplate_righthalf.stl

Finally to complete the build you need to print the rear mount twice and glue to the back of the front plate. This file works on both the whole plate and the two halfs.
- rearmount.stl

The Screen is then put through the front plate and mounted to the glued on rear mount from behind * Note I will make a photo or proper guide for this later
